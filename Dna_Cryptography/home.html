        <h3>DNA Encryption</h3>
        <p>
           DNA encryption is a method that utilizes the four nucleotide bases found in DNA (Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine) to represent characters in a message.Each nucleotide base is assigned to a specific character, enabling the encoding of a message into a DNA sequence. This process creates a unique and secure way to store and transmit information, leveraging the robustness and stability of DNA molecules.

        <h3>DNA Decryption</h3>
        <p>
          DNA decryption is the reverse process of DNA encryption, involving the decoding of a DNA sequence back into its original message. It requires reversing the mapping used during encryption and translating the DNA sequence back into characters. Despite its complexity, DNA decryption is essential for retrieving information encoded in DNA and plays a vital role in various fields such as data storage, cryptography, and biotechnology.
